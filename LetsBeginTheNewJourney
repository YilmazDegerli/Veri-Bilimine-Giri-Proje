When i have graduated from university in 2011, using a computer was not common like these days.
I tried to all my homeworks without the computer. Computer meant for me only a tool to watch movie.
Actually I knew how to use Microsoft office programs but I always had fear to learn new things especially about technology.
After graduation, I found a good job and I needed to use just basic computer programs like excel.

After long times, I had to settle down in a new country. I started to there a new life however I had two big problems.
My first problem is a learning a new language. I have should learnt German which I always run away from throughout my life.
The second problem was to find a new job.Since I donâ€™t have technical background and hard power features,
my soft power knowledges and experiences were not enough to get a new job. 
Therefore, I decided to change my all career in a new way. After making a lot of research, although I am not familiar using computer,
I decided to be a Data Scientist. I have been learning something about Data Science for 2 months. 
I am now learning from Free Online Software Courses [Patika.dev.](https://app.patika.dev/paths)

I strongly recommend these online courses. You can learn easily lots of things related with software and computer science from this site.
As I told, I have just started my coding career and I want to go to the end, no matter how hard it is. 

I wish you all success and congratulations in advance ðŸ˜Š
